# Contact Form Fix - Task Completed

## Current Work
Fixed contact form by correcting Netlify Forms configuration and removing interfering JavaScript. Form now submits directly to Netlify for processing.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Netlify Forms: Handles form submissions on static sites, requires data-netlify="true", method="POST", matching form-name in toml.
- Form submission: Let browser handle POST, Netlify processes and sends email to site owner.
- JavaScript removal: Removed custom fetch handler that was preventing proper submission.

## Relevant Files and Code
- index.html: Form with data-netlify="true", method="POST", hidden form-name="Contact Form" (matches netlify.toml).
- script.js: Removed form submit event listener; kept accordion functionality.
- netlify.toml: Kept for form configuration.

## Problem Solving
- Original issue: JavaScript fetch was overriding form submission, causing errors locally and possibly on deploy.
- Solution: Removed JavaScript override, ensured form-name matches toml, let Netlify handle submission natively.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed form-name mismatch: Changed hidden input value to "Contact Form" to match netlify.toml.
- [x] Removed JavaScript form handler: Deleted submit event listener and fetch code from script.js.
- [x] Verified form structure: Kept data-netlify, method, required fields, honeypot for spam protection.
- [x] Ready for deployment: Changes should work on Netlify deploy.

## Next Steps
- Deploy changes: Git commit and push to trigger Netlify redeploy.
- Test on live site: Submit form and verify email receipt.
- If issues persist, consider alternative like EmailJS or Formspree.
